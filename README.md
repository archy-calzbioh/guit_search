# guit_search

Implemented with Node.js and Express.

Image data is inserted into database programmatically with Google API and Google CSE.

Views are generated dynamically with ejs. 

Database: MongoDB Atlas. 

Hover behavior with jQuery and CSS

CSS based on water.css

Bounce on page load from the animate.css library

Live app hosted at https://guit-search.onrender.com/


Issues: aggregate causes errors if left to run indefinitely and the CSE runs whenever the server starts causing unnecessary API calls.
